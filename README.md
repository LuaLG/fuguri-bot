## Credits
* Chriscox462#8874 on Discord for the bot's new name, Minarobo. I added the extra "n" to make it "Minnarobo", which can roughly translate from Japanese as "everyone's robo" or "everyone's robot".
* [Favna](https://github.com/Favna) for Ribbon as my inspiration.
* [Rohul1997](http://github.com/Rohul1997) for the custom server prefix code.
* THUNDER KAI#9460 on Discord for the idea.
